<h1 align="center">Hi 👋, I'm Ismael Gómez Garrido</h1>
<h3 align="center">I build and optimize AI solutions that turn data into real-world impact</h3>

Through my engineering academic and professional background, I have developed a problem-solving mindset and strong experience in machine learning, data science learning, and data science. My work spans research and industry projects, including reinforcement learning, explainable AI, time series forecasting, and quantum methods. Published at international conferences and fluent in Spanish and English, I bring an international perspective and adaptability cultivated through studying, working, and traveling abroad. I am looking forward to applying my knowledge and experience to real-world problems.

I am passionate about exploring how AI can help us live in a better world, extending our capabilities and building systems that are powerful, fair, interpretable, and socially meaningful. Outside of technical work, I draw inspiration from chess, basketball, mountaineering, physics, backpacking, and Mesopotamian history.

- 🔭 I’m currently working on a personal project: Building a RAG system on the cloud for the generation of personalized flora and fauna reports

- ⭐ I am also working on [blindfold_chess](https://github.com/Suaif/blindfold_chess/), an application that runs TTS, STT, and LLMs locally to help you play chess without looking at the board.
