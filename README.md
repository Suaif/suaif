<h1 align="center">Hi ðŸ‘‹, I'm Ismael GÃ³mez Garrido</h1>
<h3 align="center">AI master student at Maastricht University</h3>

I am finishing my Artificial Intelligence masterâ€™s thesis and am looking forward to applying my knowledge and experience to real-world problems. I aim to discover how AI can help us live in a better world.

I consider myself proactive, responsible, and ambitious. I can work efficiently both as a team and independently. Thanks to my time traveling, studying, and working abroad, Iâ€™ve developed great social and communication skills, and I can adapt easily to international environments.

I enjoy my free time playing basketball, reading, and doing mountain climbing. I am a big fan of chess and I love to travel meet local people and discover new cultures.
